    <p><strong>Musashi Miyamoto</strong> (宮みや本もと武む蔵さし, Miyamoto Musashi) is one of the main protagonists<br> in Vagabond, and a historical figure considered one of the greatest swordsmen in Japanese history. As<br> a young man he embarks  on a journey to become the strongest samurai after being exiled from his village.<br>He was born under the name Takezou Shinmen (新しん免めん 武たけ蔵ぞう, Shinmen Takezo) but later <br>changed it to Musashi Miyamoto.</p> <br>

    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <p>In the beginning of the series, Musashi was portrayed as a hot headed young man driven by his desire to become strong,<br> with a very aggressive personality.
    One of the foremost reasons that drives Musashi to excel in sword-fighting, is his<br> desire to overcome his father for all the harsh treatment given during his childhood and Musashi's incapability to rebel.<br> This desire made him violent and feared by others, however Otsu was the only person who didn't fear him.</p> <br>
